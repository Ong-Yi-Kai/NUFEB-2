NUFEB Documentation
========================================

NUFEB (Newcastle University Frontier in Engineering Biology) 
is an open source tool for 3D individual-based simulation of microbial communities. 

NUFEB is built on top of the molecular dynamic simulator `LAMMPS <https://lammps.sandia.gov/>`_ (version: stable_29Oct2020), 
and extended
with features for microbial modelling. 
As a result, NUFEB has the realistic explicit models of biological, chemical and
physical processes, including individual microbes in different shapes. 
The current implementation takes full advantage of the LAMMPS parallel infrastructure,
allowing for massive parallel simulations on both CPU- and GPU-based systems.

NUFEB is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License. 
The development has been funded by the UKâ€™s EPSRC EP/K039083/1 Frontiers in Engineering Biology project.
