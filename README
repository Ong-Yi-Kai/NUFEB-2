This is the NUFEB development repository

NUFEB is an open source tool for modelling and simulating microbial communities.
The tool is based on the Individual-based Modelling (IbM) approach, 
where microbes are represented as discrete units and their
behaviour changes over time due to a variety of processes. 

NUFEB is built on top of the molecular dynamics simulator
LAMMPS (as a LAMMPS' user package), extended with IbM features. 
A wide range of biological, physical and
chemical processes are implemented to explicitly model microbial systems. 

NUFEB is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the terms
of the GNU Public License.

NUFEB development has been funded by the UKâ€™s EPSRC EP/K039083/1 
Newcastle University Frontiers in Engineering Biology (NUFEB) project.

NUFEB requires cmake, git, gcc/g++, openmpi, png-dev and ffmpeg for a successful build.
You can run the following commands to install the packages, 

On Ubuntu:
<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install cmake git-core g++ openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev libpng-dev ffmpeg
</pre>

On CentOS:
<pre>
sudo yum update
sudo yum install cmake git gcc-c++ openmpi openmpi-devel libpng-dev ffmpeg
</pre>

### Getting source
Get NUFEB source code and submodules for its thirdparty libraries:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/nufeb/NUFEB --recursive
</pre>

Build NUFEB:
<pre>
./install.sh
</pre>

### Running
Run a case in /examples after building NUFEB, for example:
<pre>
cd examples/biofilm-het
mpirun -np 4 ../../lammps/src/lmp_nufeb -in Inputscript.lammps
</pre>
